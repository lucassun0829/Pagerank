Due Wednesday, Jan 18, 2023 at 8pm ET
A PDF version of this document is located here.
In this project, you will implement a basic graph library in Python 3 and then implement a simplified version of PageRank, a famous algorithm in search-engine optimization. The primary learning goal of the project is to gain familiarity with the syntax, data structures, and idioms of Python 3. A secondary goal is to review the basics of abstract data types (ADTs) and object-oriented programming.
